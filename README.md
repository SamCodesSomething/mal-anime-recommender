This is a simple application to allow users to make searches on MAL API.

This was done as a personal project of mine as I wanted a way to quickly search up anime without having to log into MAL every time. I learned a TON making this application and I hope to expand this in the future.

A few things I learned making this project:
Fast API is super useful and awesome for these quick projects.
Make sure you're not accidentally leaking keys or secret information. Luckily I didn't have this issue since I caught it before it happened.
Making things functional > Making things look nice. Style can always come after substance, but not the other way around.
Being passionate about your project is way better than coding something you don't care about.

Hope you guys found this interesting!
